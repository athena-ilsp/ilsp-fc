# How to get ILSP-FC

Depending on your requirements and your system setup, there are several ways to get ILSP-FC.

## Get ILSP-FC to use from the command line

If you want to run ILSP-FC directly from the command line, you can download the latest runnable jar-with-dependencies jar file provided in the [Files](Files.md)  section of this site. See the [[GettingStarted|Getting Started]] page for usage information and examples.

## Get ILSP-FC to use in your Java project

You can integrate ILSP-FC in your own Java project in two ways.

The suggested way is by using Maven (and Eclipse). See the [Developer Setup](Developer_Setup.md) page for further information.

If you do not want to use Maven, you can use the latest source-with-dependencies zip file provided in the [Files](Files.md)  section of this site. It contains the source for ILSP-FC and jars for all third party libraries. You can add these jars to the Java build path in your favourite IDE.
